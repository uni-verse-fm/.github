This Organisation holds the code that allows the uni-verse plarform to run.

Uni-verse is initially a school project and is actively being turned into a PoC and a personnal project.
It's not production ready and nor is it simply ready at all.

The aim is taking soundcloud to the next level with several features:

- Audio sample based search
- Plagiat detection
- Collaboration
- Resource sharing for music production \*
- Privante instantaneous messaging
- An Android app for listening
- **MAYBE ONE DAY** direct daw integration through VST

<br/>

# Current state (WIP):

Currently the whole app is not functional, it has deprecated dependencies, a bit of tech debt, and I do not have a kubernetes cluster anymore.

- Translating the documentation
