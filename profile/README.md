This Organisation holds the code that allows the uni-verse plarform to run.

Uni-verse is initially a school project and is actively being turned into a PoC and a personnal project.
It's not production ready and nor is it simply ready at all.

Check out how it is built in [the wiki](https://uni-verse-fm.github.io/.github/).

The aim is taking soundcloud to the next level with several features:

- Audio sample based search
- Plagiat detection
- Collaboration
- Resource sharing for music production \*
- Privante instantaneous messaging
- An Android app for listening
- **MAYBE ONE DAY** direct daw integration through VST
